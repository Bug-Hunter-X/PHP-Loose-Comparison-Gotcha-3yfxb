In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with loosely typed variables and unexpected type juggling.  Consider this code:

```php
function checkValue($value) {
  if ($value == 0) {
    echo "Value is zero";
  } else {
    echo "Value is not zero";
  }
}

checkValue(0); // Outputs "Value is zero"
checkValue("0"); // Outputs "Value is zero" 
checkValue(false); // Outputs "Value is zero"
```

The `==` operator performs loose comparison, leading to unexpected results.  `"0"`, `0`, and `false` all evaluate to `false` in a boolean context and are considered equal to 0 under loose comparison.  This can cause hard-to-debug issues if you're not expecting these implicit type conversions.
